### Analysing Player Engagement: A Data Science Project on Team Fortress 2 (TF2) Community Servers


## Introduction ðŸ“š 

Welcome to our final project for the Data Engineering & Analytics programme at Brights Training & Academic Work. Our team has embarked on an exciting journey to explore the vibrant world of Team Fortress 2 (TF2) community servers. These servers, hosted by dedicated members of the TF2 community, breathe new life into the game by offering diverse and innovative gaming experiences. Our project delves into these community servers to uncover insights into player behaviour, aiming to enhance player retention and engagement.

## Objective ðŸŽ¯ 

The genesis of our project came from one of our team members, who manages six TF2 community servers. Intrigued by the potential of the vast data collected on these servers, we set out to analyse player interactions. Our goal is to identify patterns and understand the dynamics that influence player engagement, with the ultimate aim of improving the gaming experience and keeping the community thriving.

## The data ðŸ“Š 

Our analysis is grounded in data collected over the past 90 days, encompassing a wide range of player interactions within the game. The dataset includes detailed records from several key areas:

1. Player History: Tracks the overall activity and progression of players.
2. Connect/Disconnect Events: Provides insights into player session times and frequency.
3. Chat Logs (In-Game and Discord/Stream): Offers a glimpse into community interaction and sentiment.
